## Abstract

This extended abstract explores the problem of reconstructing 3D µCT samples by filling in "gaps" between parallel 2D µCT of isotropic rock samples, which reduce the technical cost of performing full 3D scans of 3D rock samples. We propose a novel inpainting technique that exploits the isotropic property of such 3D rocks by considering 2D µCT from a different perspective from the given 2D scans. We then employ state of the art invert GAN and AE techniques to produce good inpainting results to reconstruct the 3D sample from the concatenation of inpainted 2D samples. Empirical evidence is presented to show how our proposed method can produce accurate 2D in-painting samples.
